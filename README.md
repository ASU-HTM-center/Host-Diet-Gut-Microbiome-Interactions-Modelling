1. Human Host-Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Influence Energy Balance Model
2. Host-Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Mixed Model

## Human Host-Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Influence Energy Balance Model

### 1. System Requirement

We developed the current model using Microsoft Excel 2019. The Excel file works on most personal computers that have Excel. There is no special non-standard hardware requirements. 

### 2. Installation Guide

Users may download the Excel file without any need for software installation.

### 3. Demo

Currently the model is configured for Participant MAC1 Consuming the MD diet with intake of 1581 g per 6 d Carbohydrates, 507 g per 6 d Protein, 452 g per 6 d Fat, 303 g per 6 d Fiber, and 120 g per 6 d of Resistant Starch. A user may change the fields D2:D7 in "Dietary  Input" sheet to consider other model scenarios. 

The expected output fo rthe current model configuration is a dietary input of 644.9 gCOD/d, a fecal ouput of 70.9 gCOD/d, and an overall COD absorption efficiency of 89% (1 - 70.9/644.9). 

### 4. Instructions for use

Adjust the Dietary Input for each participant, as stated above.

## Host-Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Mixed Model

The SAS code for this model was developed by Fanchao at the Translational Research Institute in Florida. The model requires no additional instructions to use.
